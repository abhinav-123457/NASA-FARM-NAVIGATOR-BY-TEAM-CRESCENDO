    options: [
      "It affects grain quality and yield",
      "It doesn't matter when you harvest",
      "Only for pest control",
      "Only for soil health",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      "Harvesting too early reduces yield and grain quality. Harvesting too late causes grain shattering and losses. The optimal window is when grains are golden and firm.",
